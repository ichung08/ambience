# ambience

How many times have you been listening to your playlist, but the music just didn’t feel right? Countless times for us. It’s no secret that people like to listen to genres of music based on - you know, the mood, the atmosphere, the “ambience”. We wanted to create an application with music curated to your mood and emotion. Also, we wanted to create an application using AI and ML!

Our project is a music player and recommender based on a user’s facial emotion, using facial recognition and AI technology. A user will simply take a photo using their webcam on our app and the facial recognition technology will detect their emotion and provide the corresponding playlist. Users will have the option to “change ambience”, and depending on their emotion, will be provided with a different playlist. A user can also log their emotion into a journal, and provide a description of their experience with the timestamp.
